                1- Hassan Mousudi</h2>
                <h4>Iraqi artist Hassan Mossoudy has made stunning pieces that are a mix of traditional and contemporary calligraphy.

                    He portrays traditional calligraphy but with a bold and modern twist that make the letters transform into swift figures with effortless movement that dance on paper. All his work is heavily inspired by simplistic human interest. The emotion evoked through the simple movement of lines, the balance of composition and the contrast between vivid colors and white background, all contribute to the beautiful wholeness of his work.</h4>
